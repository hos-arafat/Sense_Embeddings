I do believe that it is vital to minimise the grey areas and emphasise fields for cooperation .
Finally , Mr President , Mr Santer among others spoke of taking a fresh look at institutional policy .
I agree with what he said : there is a need for both more and less Europe .
In my view , we also need a political Europe .
For example , our foreign policy has need of appropriate institutions , and in the field of employment it should be possible to take decisions at European level , but by the same token there should be more delegation of powers when it comes to implementing decisions , so as to create a fresh equilibrium between the Member States and the Union , because there really is a problem here .
Administration should therefore be less partial : all the institutions must become more democratic and more efficient , and it is no accident that we have insisted on proportionality .
